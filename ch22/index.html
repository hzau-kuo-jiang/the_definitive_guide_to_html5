	There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500
	varieties of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of
	apples, oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with
	thousands of choices.
	One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the
	variety available in each country. I live near London, in an area which is
	known for its apples.
