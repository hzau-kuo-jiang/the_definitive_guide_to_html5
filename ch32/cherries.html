	True cherry fruits are borne by members of the subgenus Cerasus, which is
	distinguished by having the flowers in small corymbs of several together
	(not singly, nor in racemes), and by having a smooth fruit with only a weak
	groove or none along one side. The subgenus is native to the temperate
	regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with two species in America,
	three in Europe, and the remainder in Asia. The majority of eating cherries
	are derived from either Prunus avium, the wild cherry (sometimes called the
	sweet cherry), or from Prunus cerasus, the sour cherry.
